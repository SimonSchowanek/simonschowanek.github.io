We are a group of researchers using quantitative approaches to answerâ€¯applied questions in natural resource management and conservation.
We are interested in both the processes that lead to ecological patterns and the processes that lead to observations.
Much of our work focuses on extracting information form non-invasive field methods, such as eDNA and camera trapping.
For example, our group has developed methods (nimbleSCR) that are now used to map the density of wolves, bears, and wolverines across Scandinavia.
These maps, as well as abundance and vital rate estimates, are provided annually to wildlife management agencies in Norway and Sweden.
We are also using camera trap data to explain vulnerability and describe activity patterns in terrestrial mammal communities inhabiting tropical forests.
